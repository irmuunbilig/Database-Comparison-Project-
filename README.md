# Database Comparison Project 
 
Objective: The primary objective of this study is to thoroughly analyze and compare the
performance of five prominent database management systems—MySQL, MongoDB,
Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j—in the context of a university curriculum management
system. This system is responsible for handling course catalogues, course scheduling,
and curriculum mapping. The aim is to identify the most suitable database solution for
managing these complex data sets efficiently, under varying workloads and query
complexities.
Motivation: Selecting the appropriate database management system is critical to
ensuring the scalability, reliability, and efficiency of the curriculum management system.
With the growing complexity of educational data—ranging from structured relational
data to graph-based relationships—this study provides valuable insights into how each
DBMS performs in handling this diverse data. The findings will help determine the
optimal choice for such applications, balancing data integrity, performance, and
scalability.
